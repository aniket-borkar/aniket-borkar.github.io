# Plasma Science Website

A beautiful, interactive website that explains plasma physics and its applications in the modern world.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices from mobile to desktop
- **Interactive Demonstrations**: Three interactive plasma simulations
  - Plasma Ball: Simulates the electric filaments in a plasma globe
  - Solar Plasma: Demonstrates how plasma behaves in stars with magnetic fields
  - Fusion Reactor: Shows how plasma is confined in a tokamak fusion reactor
- **Educational Content**: Comprehensive information about plasma physics and applications
- **Modern UI**: Clean, attractive design with smooth animations

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with modern features like CSS Grid, Flexbox, and CSS Variables)
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS with Canvas API for simulations)
- Font Awesome for icons
- Google Fonts for typography

## Interactive Simulations

The website features three interactive plasma simulations built with the HTML5 Canvas API:

1. **Plasma Ball**: Simulates the electric filaments in a plasma globe. Users can adjust the energy level and touch the plasma to see how it responds.

2. **Solar Plasma**: Demonstrates how plasma behaves in stars with magnetic fields. Users can adjust the magnetic field strength and trigger solar flares.

3. **Fusion Reactor**: Shows how plasma is confined in a tokamak fusion reactor. Users can adjust the temperature and strengthen the magnetic confinement.

## Running the Website

Simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser. No server or build process is required.

## Browser Compatibility

The website is compatible with all modern browsers that support HTML5 Canvas and CSS3 features:
- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge
